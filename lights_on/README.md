# Lights On

## Project Introduction

Night-time luminosity as captured in satellite images has been shown to be a valid proxy for a multitude of economic indicators.
The idea of this project is to provide an easy tool for economists to explore geospatial and time-dependent luminosity data for statistical analysis.


## Technology

This tool is not a package or software, but rather a combination of different open-source projects tailored to this purpose making it as easy as possible to get started without having to do lots of setup work. _Lights On_ relies heavily on:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)


## Get Started

### Notes

* On mac, the ip is not localhost but can be found as follows `docker-machine ip $(docker-machine active)`


## Data

* (Annual Nighttime Composites)[https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html]
